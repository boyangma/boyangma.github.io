## üë§ Bio
I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn), where I am a member of Professor [Yue Zhang](https://yue.zyueinfosec.com) ([Âº†ÊÇ¶](https://yue.zyueinfosec.com/cn))'s research team. I received my Ph.D. degree in Cyberspace Security from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn) in 2024, under the supervision of Professor Jinku Li ([ÊùéÈáëÂ∫ì](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/Jinku/zh_CN/index.htm)).

My research interests span computer systems security and AI security. During my doctoral studies, I specialized in ransomware detection, with a particular focus on leveraging virtualization and trusted computing technologies to develop low-level, high-assurance defense systems that operate with enhanced security guarantees. Currently, my research extends to exploring security vulnerabilities within AI systems and harnessing AI techniques to address and optimize solutions for traditional system security challenges.

I am always open to academic collaborations and discussions. Please feel free to reach out via email at [boyangma@sdu.edu.cn](mailto:boyangma@sdu.edu.cn) or [maboyang@hotmail.com](mailto:maboyang@hotmail.com) if you would like to connect or explore potential research opportunities together.
